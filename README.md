Explore HR analytics and uncover insights from employee data


In this analysis, I explore a comprehensive human resources dataset covering various attributes like personal details (names, DOBs, age, gender, marital status) and employment specifics (date of hire, termination reasons, department, employment status, position title, pay rate, manager name, performance score). Recent additions include absences, most recent performance review date, and employee engagement score. My goal is to uncover interesting and actionable insights to enhance understanding of workforce dynamics and inform strategic decision-making.
